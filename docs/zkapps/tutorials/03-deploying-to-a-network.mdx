# Tutorial 3: Deploying to a Live Network

## Overview

In previous tutorials, we've seen how to deploy and run transactions on a local network. In this tutorial, we will see how to deploy and run transactions against a real, live network.

Note that zkApps are currently available on Berkeley, Mina's public testnet, which is in its final stages of testing before mainnet. In this tutorial, we will deploy our contract to the Berkeley network.

## Project setup

First, setup a new project with 
```sh
$ zk project 03-deploying-to-a-live-network
```

You can find the complete source code of this project [here](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples).

You can delete the default files in `src`. 

We will be starting from the smart contract from tutorial `01`. 

As we've done in past tutorials, delete the default files in `src`

You can copy in `Square.ts` and `index.ts` from the first tutorial - you can find these [here](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/tree/main/01-hello-world/src)

Make a new `main.ts` file, from which we will deploy to the live Berkeley network.
